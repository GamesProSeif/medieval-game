Update 0.1.5 patchnotes:


1- fixed bug with EXP on the new sword script
2- player now checks ground with raycasts which makes it safer and doesnt make the player climb walls (supposedly)
3- new methods:
	-Jumping (since before it wasnt jumping on standby since it was under the moveplayer method)
	-Sprinting(we want the player to be able to explore more and you can't do that with super speed e.e)

bugs known : 
	for some reasons potions and nades numbers multiply ?????
